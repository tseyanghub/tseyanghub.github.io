I am Ze Yang, a tortoise-like beginner of the system research. I may move forward slowly, but I will persevere to the end. 	

The goal of my research is to make computer systems reliable and secure, especially those operating at the cloud and datacenter scale. My mission is to help today's systems defend against all kinds of errors and defects, such as software bugs, configuration errors, and design flaws. I am very happy that some of our work helps improve reliability of real-world systems.

My Nickname
======
Admin of 3111 because I was like the first element in the stack, the first to enter the lab and the last to leave, until staffs kicked me out and confiscated my folding bed.

Things that make me believe I will be a good person in both research and indutry areas.
======
My Prof. Tianyin Xu told me a story. Ya-Qin Zhang, a famous Chinese scientist, technologist and business executive, believes that the person who can eat a lot will be a good worker. The reason is that people who can eat more need to have more money to meet their food needs. So they will work harder to earn more money. And that's what I am, I'm a big eater with the abdomen full of energy.
